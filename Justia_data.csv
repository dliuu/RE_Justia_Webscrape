Can I be sued personally for a property I purchased under an llc?,I purchased a property under an llc. Unbeknownst to me the deed was fraudulent. I signed the deed back to the real owner.

Question:  Can a landlord raise rents (for unregulated unit) for Major Capital Improvement Costs and pass onto Tenant,"This is for an Apartment in a 3-family property so all Apartments are unregulated.  Tenants moved in recently, there is no signed lease (with BOTH parties having signed).  Tenants signed, but the Landlord has not signed.  So Tenants claim there is an oral lease in place.  However, I believe there are mechanisms for raising rents for Major Capitol Improvements that may be necessary, even if there is supposedly an oral lease in place. Landlord claims there is no lease because it was not ratified or signed by both parties.  Landlord believes Tenants are in Month to Month Tenancy, which is fine, but Landlord will have to raise rents starting in November 1 due to Major Capital Improvements costs.  Even if there was an &quot;oral lease&quot; in place, there is a law that allows Major Capitol Improvement Costs to passed onto Tenants, no?","Rent increases for Major Capital Improvements (&quot;MCIs&quot;) relate only to rent regulated properties.  In unregulated properties, landlords are not required to justify the reason for a rent increase.   If a tenant has a lease for a specific term, the rent cannot generally be increased until the lease expires unless the terms of the lease provide a specific exception allowing the landlord to do so.  In non rent-regulated apartments, Landlords are required to provide written notice to tenants if they intend to raise rent by five percent or more. The landlord must provide such notice at least: 30 days in advance of renewal if a tenant has lived in the apartment less than one year and has less than a 12-month lease.",2

Even if there was an &quot;oral lease&quot; in place, there is a law that allows Major Capitol Improvement Costs to passed onto Tenants, no?","Dear Landlord: 
 
You really should have an attorney. You have confused several legal concepts. New York State allows for an oral lease of residential property for up to one year. Your offer of a one-year lease may very well be deemed an oral lease, as you were the proponent, and the tenant signed the lease. Does the lease contain the terms that this lease is not effective until signed by both tenant and landlord? If so, letting the tenant move in without you also signing the lease seems like you now have an oral lease for one year. If so, you are bound by the terms and conditions of the lease, and there is no rent increase available.  
 
There is no legal notion of Major Capital Improvement (rent increase) beyond Rent Stabilization (and Rent Control). In a non-regulated rental, the landlord does not need any reason to offer a new lease (Real Property Law Section 226-C) with a rent increase of more than 5% above the current rent. But you cannot do so during the current lease.  
 
Do you want a long-term relationship with this tenant (decide with an attorney if this makes sense--as the tenant has some understanding of the law)? If you do, why did you offer a lease and allow the tenant to move in without signing the lease? With a lawyer, you may develop a written proposal for a long-term lease with a new rent structure to give the tenant.",0
As a landlord how much notice do I have to provide tenants to leave property if I’m in the process of selling?,"New York, NY asked on September 6, 2023 in Landlord - Tenant for New York","Generally, landlord&#039;s are not required to provide any advance notice to tenants that a property is being sold.  Instead the purchaser simply steps into the shoes of the seller in relationship to the tenants after the closing.  If the owner is seeking to have non-rent regulated tenants move in contemplation of an anticipated sale, the amount of notice depends on the length of the tenancy ranging from 30 to 90 days and the owner may have to commence a holdover proceeding in Housing Court against tenants that fail to honor the notice.  Therefore, it can take significantly longer to actually compel tenants to vacate regardless of a pending sale.",0

Ordinarily, mere negligence (not gross) will not even help you in the recovery of monetary damages in a lawsuit in Small Claims Court. Your homeowner insurance may provide relief. 
 
Generally, in an ordinary apartment residential rental, the landlord is always responsible for making repairs to appliances and maintaining the rented apartment in the same condition as when the tenant took over occupancy. Your service contracts may cover the expense of repairs. If not, you cannot draw down from the tenant&#039;s security deposit for repairs occasioned by the tenant&#039;s intentional destruction, before the tenant vacates the apartment. When you deal with a tenant moving out you must itemize the damages caused by the tenant, beyond ordinary wear and tear, in writing and do so within 14 days after the tenant moved out.  
 
There is an exception to the general rule. A landlord renting an entire single-family house to a tenant may use the lease as a means to shift the burden of repairs upon the tenant.",0

Can a landlord contract out (eg lease says 60 days) of the NYC law to return a security deposit in 14 days?,"New York, NY asked on September 19, 2023 in Landlord - Tenant for New York","In New York, state law mandates that a landlord must return a security deposit within 14 days after the tenant has vacated the property. Even if a lease agreement states a different duration, such as 60 days, provisions that attempt to waive or diminish a tenant&#039;s rights under the law are generally unenforceable. Thus, in NYC, a landlord cannot contract out of the 14-day requirement to return a security deposit.",1

"Real Estate Closing, NY  
 Is it legal for my lawyer to hire a lawyer to represent me at closing, without my permission?",I was charged for the outside lawyer to represent me at the closing.,"If your lawyer hired another lawyer to represent you at a real estate closing without your permission and you were charged for their services, it&#039;s important to consider the legality and appropriateness of this situation. In many cases, lawyers are expected to obtain their clients&#039; consent before involving additional legal representation that comes with associated costs. If you were charged for the services of the outside lawyer without prior agreement, you might want to discuss this matter with your lawyer to seek clarification on why the decision was made and to address any concerns you have about the charges. If the situation remains unresolved, consulting legal resources or seeking advice from appropriate legal bodies in your jurisdiction could provide insights into whether this practice adheres to legal and ethical standards.",0
"Real Estate Closing, NY  
 Is it legal for my lawyer to hire a lawyer to represent me at closing, without my permission?",I was charged for the outside lawyer to represent me at the closing.,"It has been my experience that if you have a &quot;retainer&quot; agreement with the attorney, such agreement often includes language that says that the attorney might associate themselves with others to help you complete your matter.  Often real estate closings occur without retainer agreements because most times the attorney charges less than the amount where a written retainer is requred ($3,000 in NY).   So, it sounds like your attorney needed to have your closing covered to get it closed for you.   It is not &quot;illegal,&quot; but you probably should have been advised it was going to happen.",1

Result: Friday, March 3, 2023 
 
But you left out the very important stuff a lawyer would get from you with a simple phone call. How did you receive the Rent Demand? Legal Service is in-person delivery or failing two separate efforts to place the Rent Demand in your hand, taping a copy or more upon the apartment door, or slipping those copies of the Rent Demand under the door PLUS additional copies by regular mail and by certified mail. Personal Delivery counts the day placed in your hand. 
 
On top of this, we do not know how your landlord is figuring out when time is up and if it is safe to file the Petition online at NYSCEF and initiate the nonpayment proceeding. We do not know the date of service recited in the affidavit of service completed by the process server. 
 
With all that in the real world often delays commencing the lawsuit are typical.  
 
The point is you do not want to wait until you are forced into paying the rent when the landlord files the nonpayment case or worse with the need to deal with this in court. 
 
I never counsel clients to wait until the day I calculate is the last day of 14 to pay and then pay on that day.",0

When a person dies intestate, that person&#039;s property is distributed according to the law. In New York, that law is found in EPTL 4-1.1. 
 
Who gets what depends on who the living relatives are and their relationship to the Decedent, the person who died. The family members who are entitled to a share of the Decedent&#039;s estate when there is no will are called &quot;distributees&quot;. 
 
In the simplest terms: 
 
If the Decedent has... then 
a spouse (husband or wife) and no children the spouse inherits everything 
children* but no spouse children inherit everything 
spouse and children* the spouse inherits the first $50,000 plus half of the balance. The children* inherit everything else. 
parents but no spouse and no children* the parents inherit everything 
siblings (brothers or sisters) but no spouse, children*, or parents the siblings inherit everything 
* If a child dies before the Decedent and had children of their own, then the Decedent would have grandchildren. Those grandchildren would step into the Decedent&#039;s child&#039;s place and inherit in place of the child. 
About Decedent&#039;s Children 
For children to inherit from their parents, New York State requires that there is legal parent-child relationship. In most cases this is not an issue but it&#039;s not always clear. 
 
Adopted children will inherit just like a biological child. 
Foster children and stepchildren will not inherit unless they were legally adopted. 
Children born after the Decedent dies will inherit. 
Children born outside of marriage, also called non-marital child, will inherit from a male Decedent if paternity is established 
Grandchildren will inherit only if their parent (the Decedent&#039;s child) dies before the Decedent died.

Can I sue in small claims court if my landlord doesn’t return the flooding assistance application back to me?,"Due to hurricane Ida, our 3 bedroom basement apartment got flooded. Because of this we were forced to stay in a hotel for 2 nights, which the landlord agreed to discount from the rent. When we got back to the apt we noticed the walls were damaged, and so was our furniture. Because it’s  a basement, due to the humidity mold started growing. The mold formed on the walls and in our furniture. We got an application from 311 to help us replace the furniture but needed a letter from the landlord explaining the situation and damages. The landlord agreed to give us the letter and we gave them the application but they have not returned it. A few weeks later a pipe in the 1st floor burst at 3 am and water started coming from the ceilings. Again, more of our furniture was damaged, including our fridge.

If you complete and submit the Hardship declaration, the landlord will be stayed from moving forward with an eviction case against you until at least January 15, 2022.

If your friend will not voluntarily leave, you would need to start a holdover proceeding in Housing Court to obtain a legal eviction.  It is important that the predicate notice and court papers be completedly properly or your case will be subject to dismissal, so always better to have an attorney represent you.",0
Can a co-op board elect themselves at the annual election meeting because no new candidates announced their candidacy?,"Our by-laws dictate that the board must have an annual election meeting to elect board members. Because no new candidates announced their candidacy, the board decided not to hold the elections at the meeting and the current Board will remain until the next year. 
 
The by-laws do have strict language to have an election meeting, how to conduct the vote and vote counting, but it does not say anything about the announcement of candidates.  
 
The board is of the opinion that because they gave the shareholders  a 10 day notice to announce their candidacy and no one responded, that therefore the absence of new candidates  automatically elected the current incumbents to a new term. 
 
Is the board in violations of the by-laws?","In order to give an accurate answer, the By-Laws would have to be reviewed.  Some By-Laws will allow the current board to remain in place until a meeting with the proper quorum is present to hold elections or other variations that could make your Board&#039;s actions go either way.",0
Am I still on the hook for the full price of my current lease if my landlord finds another tenant at a lower price? (NY),"I am currently living in NYC and am on a lease that ends May 31, 2021. However, my roommate and I have decided to vacate the property early. Our landlord has agreed that he will list the property and we hope to get someone in by the time we are out (end of March).  
 
Given the current rental market, our landlord has listed the property at significantly less than what we were paying and has said that we would be required to pay the difference for the months that we are not on the property from the original terms of our lease.  
 
I just want to confirm that this is legal given there would be two leases on the property? I understand he would be out some $$ from our original contract, so I can understand how that might make sense. However, given he&#039;s found new tenants, I just want to confirm.","When you break a lease, damages would typically be measured as the total amount of unpaid rent for the remaining term.  In the case you described, the landlord has taken steps to mitigate or lessen the total amount of damages by finding a substitute tenant.  If the substitute tenant&#039;s rent is lower than the original rent, the difference is damages still due to the landlord.",0

Their visit is also required to be made at a &quot;reasonable&quot; time, which generally means after 9am and before 5pm, exclusive of weekends.

what are the pros and cons of land lease buildings,i have to move. i saw a coop in my budget but dont want to get into some deal that comes back to bite me in a few years,"Unlike the usualy situation where a coop owns the land that its building is contructed on, a private land lease arrangements mean the coop essentially leases the land that its building sits upon.  When that land lease expires, the owner of the land can negotiate and obtain a large increase in the rent for the underlying lease.  As a result of the uncertainty regarding future costs, coop unit prices tend to drop significantly as the end of the land lease expires due to uncertainty and expected rising costs.",0

what are the pros &amp; cons of doing a joint tenancy vs common tenancy house deed  (adding four kids to parents deed evenly,Four kids will inherit house after parents last away evenly (25% each ) we are updating the deed and was asked whether it’d be joint v common tenancy,"Your question raises a number of important issues.  If the parents add the children to the deed with them as owners, each of the children would acquire a present interest in the property.  Assuming two parents and four children on the deed, each would be presumed to own 1/6 of the property unless otherwise specified.  In addition, judgments against any of the owners could become liens on the property and any one owner could file for partitition and potentially force a sale of the entire house. 
 
If you have already considered those issues, the difference between tenants-in-common and joint tenants pertains to the right of survivorship.  For example, business partners typically own property as tenants-in-common and if one of the partner&#039;s pass away the deceased owner&#039;s share in the property is inherited by his or her heirs or beneficiaries.  In the case of joint tenants, the survivor(s) acquires the interest of a deceased joint tenant and nothing passes to the deceased owner&#039;s heirs or beneficiaries.",0
Wanted to terminate my lease earlier because of financial hardship due to COVID -19!,"Due to the pandemic, I experience financial hardship.

The landlord states that I will be responsible for the rent until the apartment is occupied by someone or pay a 3-month rent fee (closed to $12000), which will put our financial situation in jeopardy. After reading the lease several times. nothing stated anything of what they told me and not even a mention of early termination or notice! Can I leave a 30 days notice and not been penalized as they said?","When you sign a lease you are entering into a contract.  The landlord is promising to rent you space for a specific use and a specific period of time.  Likewise, the tenant is promising to rent a particular space for a specific use for a specified period of time.  Unless there is a clause in the lease that allows for earlier termination, there is no right for either side to terminate a lease early.  There is nothing a landlord can do to stop a tenant from moving; however, moving does not end the tenant&#039;s obligation to pay rent.  In New York, the landlord has a duty to try to mitigate damages by attempting to re-rent an apartment but in this market it is very difficult for landlords to find new tenants.  Bottom line, the tenant can be responsible for the full rent until the end of the lease regardless of whether they remain in a rental unit.   
 
Some landlord&#039;s may offer tenants an option to terminate a lease early for a fee even if this provision is not in the lease.  The landlord&#039;s have the right to make this type of offer but cannot be forced to do so unless the lease requires it.  Some tenants accept this type of deal to limit their exposure for continued liability under the lease but you can always take your chances that the landlord won&#039;t actually sue you for the remaining balance of your lease.",0

Also, she lived in my home from 2015-2020, was evicted in December, 2019, signed a Stipulation of Settlement to vacate May 31, 2020 and now claiming ownership under Fraudulent conveyance. Does this make any sense?","Not necessarily.  If you are being sued for &quot;partition&quot;, a filing for an accounting is also often sought.  That does not automatically mean you are entitled to contribution towards expenses... especially if you benefitted from exclusive use and control of property during that time.  In addition, there are Statutes of Limitations that prevent claims that date back too far.  If you have been sued for partitition, give serious consideration to retaining an attorney to defend your interests.",1
"No contract was signed, how would we go about changing our bid?",We found a property of interest in East Northport Long Island. Price on property was listed for $425K with property tax of $4781/yearly. This was also a listing of our agent. She informed us there are multiple offers since the property was priced below market value. We had offered 525K &amp; they accepted our offer. Now I think about it we jumped the gun. We love the property because it’s such a steal for .25 acres and under 5K for property tax. After doing some research we realized agents may use phantom offers to trick us bidding the highest price. We would like to know are there any strategies or loopholes that can help us potentially bring down the price we offered. Advice is much appreciated!,"Generally, real estate contracts are not binding until reduced to a writing sold by both parties.  Therefore, if you made a verbal offer, this alone would not usually bind you and, in that case, you may simply be able to withrdraw your offer.  Although you can make a lower offer, the seller or may not decide to negotiate with you further.",0
Can I pursue consequential damage if the landlord failed to deliver the house?,"I live in Rochester, NY. signed a lease with the landlord saying the lease starts 9/7.

This way the purchase price and sale are confirmed and you become the immediate owner of the property.  When the balloon mortgage comes due, you could refinance so you you let your father enjoy the proceeds.",0

What are the consequences of an illegal basement apartment in Brooklyn?,"I&#039;m thinking of converting my cellar into a one bedroom &quot;apartment&quot;. It will have a full three fixture bathroom, a kitchen fixture, a door connecting to the outside and most likely a 3x2 window to the outside. I&#039;ll be adding a fire alarm and a monoxide detector as well for additional safety. 
 
What I&#039;m looking for are both consequences and the reality of it being forced. For example, from what I understand NYC DOB rarely enforces or gets a search warrant to inspect the area of interest (despite the inspectors taking the time to show up without a warrant). I&#039;m weighing pros and cons here. I understand the success of an illegal cellar is contingent on the complicity of the tenants, so I would be looking to rent to family friends who wouldn&#039;t give me any trouble. 
 
Additionally, does having a basement apartment make a fire insurance policy void?","Why not just make it legal and convert your home into a two family?  You are not correct about there being no inspections.  Also, you cannot enforce a lease of an illegal space.  It also will hinder any sale or refinancing.  Finally, it violates your insurance, and could lead to a lack of coverage.   In short, not a good idea.",0

Additionally, does having a basement apartment make a fire insurance policy void?","From the phrasing of your question, it is obvious you know creating a basement apartment is problematic.  In over 30 years of handling L/T matters, I have met many clients that have elected to ignore the law and create illegal apartments.  Some get away with it for years before they get caught.  However, when a tenant, family member or neighbor, decides not to play along, things can get ugly quickly.  If, for example, you have a legal two family house and create a third &quot;illegal&quot; unit in the basement, attic or by subdividing one of the two legal units, you can be prevented from collecting rent from any tenants and face significant fines.  Also if a tenant is injured or there is a property damage claim, an owner can be surprised to learn his/her insurance won&#039;t cover it and can be subject to criminal charges in certain circumstances.",0

We also been making noise complaints and bleaching our clothes by the upstairs neighbors and the landlord doesn&#039;t do anything about it.

If you break your lease, you can be liable to the landlord for the remaining term of your lease.  In New York, the landlord has an obligation to seek to mitigate damages by re-renting your apartment.  However, you have the option of presenting a replacement tenant to the landlord.  If the landlord rejects your replacement tenant you may have the basis to defend against any claim by the landlord for unpaid rent because the landlord will be deemed to have refused to mitigate damages.",0

Will eviction warrants be allowed to process for holdover cases on June 20th in NYC ?,"Brooklyn, NY asked on June 8, 2020 in Landlord - Tenant for New York","Pursuant to Executive Order 202.28, the moratorium of evictions was extended through August 19, 2020.

I own a barbershop/salon the landlord wants 2 months of rent I&#039;m suffering by the COVID19 Virus what is the best option?,"Staten Island, NY asked on May 17, 2020 in Real Estate Law, Business Law and Landlord - Tenant for New York","Pursuant to Governor Cuomo&#039;s Executive Order, the moratorium on evictions has been extended to August 20th, so there is no immediate threat of eviction.  However, the Executive Order does not relieve a tenant&#039;s obligation to pay rent....  It just temporarily removes the ability of the landlord to evict because of it.  Ultimately, individual tenants will have to negotiate with their landlords that hopefully allows them to catch up on arrears and keep their rental units.  Some landlords may forgive a portion of the past due rent but they are not currently under an obligation to do so.  Business owners can and should investigate government programs, such as PPP to obtain financial assistance.",0

Generally, the parties can negotiate for the money to be deposited in an interest earning account.

Hello I wanted to know if you can use your security deposit to cover your last month of rent?,"My lease states “landlord may use the security to put amounts owed by tenant, including damages.”","This is a complicated question because the laws on security deposits chanced in June 2019. Here are the most relevant legal provisions that can assist you:  
 
General Obligations Law Section 7 
https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GOB/7-108 
 
The Rent stabilization code Section2525.4 (if you are rent stabilized)

Hello I wanted to know if you can use your security deposit to cover your last month of rent?,"My lease states “landlord may use the security to put amounts owed by tenant, including damages.”","Technically, most leases do not allow a tenant to apply a security deposit to the last month of rent.  This makes sense because a security deposit is intended to protect a landlord for the cost of damages to the apartment.  If it is used for last month&#039;s rent, a landlord would then have no security.   
 
In practice, many tenants refuse to pay last months&#039; rent regardless of lease provisions because of concern landlords may not return the full security deposit or do so in a timely manner.  Using your security deposit to cover last month&#039;s rent may interfere with getting a positive recommendation from an existing landlord if it is requested by a prospective landlord.",0

1. Constantly asking me who is living with me or if I have anyone in my apartment (I am the only one on the lease, but my boyfriend visits a lot). However, the super stops me and asks about my living situation often, even though I express I live alone  
 
2. Pretending he is mopping the floor so he can eavesdrop at my door (I witnessed him do this through the peephole of my apartment) 
 
3. Watching my interactions with my family in front of the building 
 
4. Raising his voice and insisting that I come to his apartment so we can discuss a “paper”. When I asked him what the conversation needed to be about he kept insisting that I come to his apartment 
 
These are a few actions he has done which has caused me to feel uncomfortable. I have notified my broker and management of his behavior.

The spelling of my husband’s first name is different on his most recent driver’s license than on our mortgage documents,"My husband and I are very close to our closing date.

You would need to ascertain who is the vested owner of the property by having a &quot;last deed search&quot; run. Once you are in receipt of the deed, this will reflect who is the &quot;of record&quot; owner of the property. If it is discovered that the land is currently owned by someone who is now deceased, you would need to see if this person had a Will that dictated to whom ownership of the property would pass too upon their demise. If no formal Will or testementary provisions were made, then the &quot;Intestate Statute&quot; would apply..whereby spouses, issue, etc. would be entitled to ownership of the property as &quot;heirs at law&quot;.

To the extent it was a binding promise (which is unclear) we also do not have sufficient information to determine whether duress would invalidate an otherwise enforceable obligation.  Duress can render a contract unenforceable, but it depends on the circumstances.

The rebuttal presumption would be that if her mother was to receive 1/3 of the profits from the sale of the home, her mother would have been added to the deed as a 1/3 owner; this did not occur. 
 
In the alternative...(and courts typically do NOT incorporate ancillary agreements as to the sale of the property aside from the what the deed reflects as far as % of ownership interest).. a more formal, authenticated agreement....signed by all parties who were in title to the home...with two attesting witnesses...with all signatures notarized.... existed that specified &quot;she is entitled to 1/3 of the NET SALE proceeds of the home&quot;....specifying the reason why....then PERHAPS a legal argument can be made that your mother in law was entitled to 1/3 of the NET SALE Proceeds. 
 
That said, based on your fact pattern, I would argue that there is no right, claim, or entitlement by your mother in law to ANY proceeds received from the sale of the home.

Also, once you are in contract the buyer can not simply “withdraw the offer,” because you have more than an offer, you have an accepted offer and a contract.  If she no longer wants to proceed with the sale, you can try to work something out to avoid losing the whole deposit, or maybe they breached in some other way that can act as an offset to use in negotiation.

Is there a way to tell if a real estate selling agent is legitimately raising the asking price of a house?,"I was interested in a house that came on the market for $230K. After viewing, I made an offer. A few days went by and my agent said the seller had a better offer, so I offered more than the alleged other buyer offered. Again, I was contacted and told the other buyer had topped my offer. I again had to raise my bid. I eventually bought the house for $288K, but felt the selling agent was just saying there were better offers to get the price up. I asked my agent and she said that that are regulations that prevent that, but I don&#039;t know about those things.","Off hand, I am unaware of a specific prohibition of such unethical conduct.  If one obtains proof or a pattern of this conduct unique to that agent, then complaint may be filed with the NYS Dept. of State which licenses real estate brokers and agents and they may investigate.  However, a hunch is not good enough, and one had better accumulate evidence.   Dealing with an agent with a long, solid reputation is good advice for seeking any professional, including real estate agents.   While it is suspicious that it took an additional $58,000 (over a 25% increase!) to close the deal, the decision is the buyer&#039;s.  Bidding wars are always dangerous.  One must be willing to walk away from any deal and have a maximum price in one&#039;s head.",2

"I&#039;m in Ch13, had COVID foreclosure protection, but the bank fraudulently filed &amp; received Termination of Automatic Stay","While under COVID-19-Related Hardship Foreclosure Protection (from 3/25/2021-9/20/2021) which my mortgage company extended to me upon my written request after filing the COVID-19 Hardship Form, their attorneys filed Notice of Motion and Motion for Termination of the Automatic Stay. I was not fully aware of the magnitude of this violation until recently, i.e., that no one was permitted to attempt to foreclose while I was in protection - the whole thing simply &#039;happened&#039; while my Chapter 13 attorney (who should have known about the protection) did NOT challenge the Motion and the Court Order was issued on 9/22/2021, albeit after the expiration of the protection period. I believe the mortgage company likely committed a crime and fraud upon the court, as the court was not told of the foreclosure protection. My attorney should bear some serious responsibility. Currently, I am ending a forbearance agreement (9/1/2023) and the bank will NOT renew. This all seems highly illegal and fraudulent.","Based upon the facts you&#039;ve presented, it doesn&#039;t sound as if any fraud was committed - though I do sympathize with your frustration. 
 
In just about any case, non-payment of your mortgage is grounds for termination of the Automatic Stay in a Bankruptcy Case. The COVID-19 Hardship Affidavit only stayed a foreclosure action in State Court, not the Federal Courts - so there was nothing impermissible about the Bank filing a Motion for Relief from Stay... it would be another story if they continued the foreclosure action in State Court after the Stay was lifted. 
 
It is rather unfortunate that your attorney did not inform you of the Motion for Relief. With that said, the Motion would have also been served upon you via mail. Still, it is rather unfortunate that there was a breakdown in communication between you and your legal counsel. 
 
My honest advice is that you allocate your limited funds towards saving the house. Litigating accusations of fraud against the Bank will only cost you time and money that could otherwise be parlayed towards a resolution that prevents the loss of your home. Winning a case of fraud against the Bank, at best, might garner an award of a few thousand dollars... and then leaving you with a foreclosure to deal with afterwards - you would be extremely unlikely to get a discharge of the mortgage by successfully litigating accusations of fraud against your mortgage lender. 
 
For what it&#039;s worth, I talk to a lot of people who are angry with their mortgage lenders (some for better reasons than others). At the end of the day, what&#039;s most important is saving your home from foreclosure and preserving affordable shelter. Animus towards the Bank shouldn&#039;t take priority. Just two cents from a guy who dies this stuff for a living... 
 
Good luck with your case!",3

In situations where there may have been a violation of court orders or misconduct by your own attorney, it could potentially be beneficial to consult with another attorney to review the specifics of your case and possibly represent your interests moving forward. Under California law, if there was indeed a violation of the automatic stay provision, you might have the ability to file a motion to have the stay reinstated and potentially pursue sanctions against the mortgage company for violating the stay; however, because of the complexity of your situation, I would strongly recommend seeking a consultation with an attorney experienced in both bankruptcy and foreclosure matters as soon as possible to explore the best course of action.",0

What does this mean?,"That is a Jury Waiver Clause. New York Courts consider the lease as an agreement made by parties with the same power to negotiate terms and conditions of the contract, even though everyone knows that there is no level playing field. A lease for most residential tenants is a take-it-or-leave-it matter. An ordinary tenant has no leverage to negotiate a right to trial by jury and so eliminate the jury waiver clause.

It is not valid in a personal injury matter and in a property damage lawsuit [https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/RPP/259-C]

Best Regards, 
 
Robert R","Less likely than with the credit card debt.   
 
Because secured creditors are in an improved position over unsecured creditors, they have less incentive to settle debts; unsecured creditors often have little to no recourse from a debtor (who may, e.g., die or file bankruptcy).  Letting a mortgage note fall into default involves risk because the house will eventually go into foreclosure, risking a loss of the property (although NY has a relatively borrower-friendly judicial process the mortgage lender must go through).   
 
For this reason, lenders will not often accept a &quot;short payoff,&quot; unless there is good a reason to.  Some of this will depend on the value of the property.  If there is equity, it is even less likely because the lender is more-secured and can afford to wait out the time it takes to foreclose, receiving interest, late fees and attorneys fees along the way.",3

The application states that the security is forfeited after 2 weeks if a lease is not signed. This was on March 17th. We had agreed I could sign the lease in mid-April (no exact date). I had decided to go with a different apartment (19 days later, counting non-business days), but to my understanding, the two weeks would begin 14 days before signing the lease, since there was no agreed upon date. Is there a loophole I could find?","They are taking advantage of you since you are in Anchorage and out of reach of suing in NYC Small Claims Court. There is no such thing as a &quot;security deposit&quot; without the existence of a lease. The two fit as a hand in a glove. Whatever money you paid to hold the apartment for you is not a &quot;security deposit.&quot; A &quot;security deposit&quot; is not paid with an application. A so-called &#039;hold deposit&#039; may be subject to a forfeit if there is full advance written disclosure of the risk involved in refusing to enter into a lease, and the prospective tenant signed a written acknowledgment of that risk.",2
How do you go about pursuing elder abuse without the elders agreeing?,My sister is taking financial advantage of my parents. My parents know enough to agree she is but do not want to pursue legal ramifications . My concern is they will not have enough money to live out their years. Most recently my dad was removed from the deed of his second home while in the icu giving my sister and brother in law full title to house but leaving my dad as sole borrower of mortgage. The signature is believed to be falsified and the notary is under investigation with NYS as claiming it was remote. He did not have mental capacity to engage in any financial transactions . My parents are afraid my sister will get in trouble so keep covering for her unscrupulous acts. Is there anything I can do to civilly get his name back on house or force the mortgage to be assumed or refinanced into their names relieving him of the debt? My sister lives in the house,"Sounds like you should pursue guardianship litigation, or get a power of attorney from your parents and then sue.

Regarding the note and mortgage, you are each jointly and severally liable, which means that each bears legal responsibility on the whole amount. As well, the property itself is liable, which means that if the note is not paid, the lender may be able to foreclose upon  whatever portion of the property is encumbered by the mortgage. It would be wise to seek counsel now to explore your options in advance of any default on the mortgage.",1

Based on what you&#039;ve stated, his payment of $200 per month sounds like it would amount to less than rent would have been, so even if he were to sue you for &quot;improvements&quot; or &quot;unjust enrichment,&quot; he would not likely recover anything.   
 
The OTHER issue you may not have considered is that your boyfriend remains on the hook for your monthly payments.  From his perspective (to play Devil&#039;s Advocate), you need to remember that (1) if you miss any mortgage payments, the bank can always turn to him because he&#039;s obligated to pay just as you are for the length of the loan (28 more years?); and (2) If he wants to buy a home (or even a car), he&#039;s got a mortgage on his credit report that will probably prevent him from doing so.  Unless you are able and willing to refinance the house without him on the note, he has liability here, and there may be a value for him to accept that.  Maybe $50,000 is a fair payoff?  It&#039;s not for me to say.  You and he need to figure this out, and you probably each need a lawyer to negotiate and draft a buyout/settlement that contemplates all these possibilities (I think it would b a conflict for one attorney to represent both of you).

First, I am not sure I fully understand the background you provided but are you saying that you responded to a home listing and the realtor (a &quot;dual agent&quot;) was the actual seller?  While I agree with your self-assessment that you should have had an inspection (as is - or not), I wonder whether the realtor/seller had a conflict of interest.  A true dual agent has a fiduciary duty to be loyal/faithful to both sides and if she (herself) is/was the other side, I do not see she could act fairly - and, in fact, from what you described, she may not have.   
 
Next, did she complete and provide you with a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (&quot;PCDS&quot;)?  If not, did you get a $500 credit and did you sign a statement that you accepted the $500 in lieu of her PCDS?   
 
Finally, I recommend you get to a local attorney as soon as possible to review all the documentation and facts to ascertain your obligations and rights under that agreement.

Were you properly served with a written notification required by the Statute (NYS Real Property Law Section 226-C [https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/RPP/226-C]) because that is the ONLY method allowed by State Law for a Landlord to inform a Tenant that there is no forthcoming offer of a new lease?

The Retaliation Eviction Law comes into play only after the landlord files the eviction lawsuit (Holdover Summary Proceeding) in NYC Housing Court.

Everything else is on and thanks to me.","From a practical perspective (which is what it sounds like you are asking), an appropriate way to split income from the unit would be to first deduct all expenses and then to split the net income according to proportions of rent paid.   
 
So first you would deduct all of the fees and costs you have incurred; the maintenance of the AirBnb account, cleaner, photographer fees, etc. from the net, either until each is repaid in full, or as each comes due each month.   For things like your time in doing these things where it is not an out of pocket expense, you could come to an agreement as to how much each service is worth and use that as the deduction.  In terms of decorations and the like, if they are purchased expressly for the rental, they would also be deducted.  If not, and they are just your furniture that you would some day take with you, they could be depreciated if you wanted to get nit-picky, though it may not be worth the effort to determine this (as much of the depreciation occurs upon purchase).  After all of those deductions, and deductions for things like taxes that would be owed, you would split whatever is left according to the proportion of rent you pay (it sounds like that is 50/50).

Hello. If your apartment is in a building with at least two more apartments, you must be very careful.  
 
First, your lease may prohibit Airbnb. Most leases in NYC will not allow for use of the apartment for short-term rental. Most leases prohibit profiteering and commercial use.  
 
NYC requires Airbnb deliver Host information. There are various reasons, but you could look this up &quot;is it legal to Airbnb in NYC&quot;.  
 
Next, NYC prohibits unhosted short-term rentals as well as advertising the apartment. The financial penalties are severe. The building landlord is subject to fines as well.  
 
NYC will tax the money earned.  
 
If your lease does not allow for short-term rental or if you run afoul of NYC and State Law prohibiting short-term rental  you will face eviction. 
 
A record of a filed eviction lawsuit will likely haunt you and any other person identified by name in the lawsuit. While NYS landlords may not rely on subscription to Tenant Blacklists, other States do not prevent a prospective landlord to deny renting to a person with an eviction history in NYC.",1

Everything else is on and thanks to me.","Determining how to split the profit from your Airbnb listing can be a complex issue that may depend on a number of factors, including the financial contributions of each party, the level of effort and involvement required, and any other agreements or arrangements you have in place. 
 
Based on the information you provided, it sounds like you have made significant financial and practical contributions to the Airbnb listing, including paying for the deposit, guarantor fee, and furnishings, as well as managing the account and coordinating with cleaners and photographers. Your boyfriend has contributed by paying half of the rent and providing his SSN/TIN to post the Airbnb listing. 
 
One possible way to split the profit fairly could be to divide it based on the proportion of financial contributions each party has made. For example, you could calculate the total cost of the deposit, furnishings, and other expenses related to the Airbnb listing, and determine what percentage of those costs you have covered versus what percentage your boyfriend has covered. You could then split the profit from the Airbnb listing in the same proportions. 
 
Another approach could be to divide the profit based on the level of effort and involvement required for each party. For example, you could keep track of the time you spend managing the account and coordinating with cleaners and photographers, and compare that to the time your boyfriend spends communicating with guests and managing the rental while guests are there. You could then split the profit based on the level of effort and involvement required. 
 
Ultimately, the best way to determine how to split the profit may be to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your respective contributions and expectations. You may want to consult with a financial advisor or accountant who has experience with rental income to help you determine a fair split.",0
"In nyc, if I live in a multi family unit, can I do short term rentals less than 30 days?","Brooklyn, NY asked on February 12, 2023 in Real Estate Law and Landlord - Tenant for New York","Dear Brooklyn Tenant:

It is illegal to do so in an unhosted setting. But even where allowed by the controlling statute an STR likely is a breach of the lease. If caught with a short-term rental there is a risk of a significant fine from the NYC Department of Buildings and eviction.

"My grandparents died and the house is still under their name, I need to put the house in my mother&#039;s name.",I also have to change the electric and water to her name and was told I needed an Affidavit.,"The answer will depend on whether someone, in addition to your grandparents are on the Deed and if so what type of ownership. 
 
Certain facts must be known before it can determined if the house can be put in your mother&#039;s name. Not an exhaustive list of questions: Did your grandparents leave Wills; what do the Wills say about who gets the assets; does your mother have siblings or nieces/nephews from predeceased siblings; is there a mortgage or reverse mortgage on the house; was the house owned by your grandparents alone or jointly with someone. 
 
Generally only a court appointed fiduciary can change ownership on he Deed. The fiduciary is appointed by the court on petition of the person who wants that role. A fiduciary is appropriate whether or not there is a Will. The fiduciary is obligated to follow the terms of the Will or the laws of intestacy. 
 
Without more information about the meters, I cannot say what is needed. Generally action should be taken to preserve the house, which likely would include keeping the electricity at least on until the ownership is settled. The cost  for doing that would be chargeable to the estate.",1
What happens after you default mortgage 120 days,"Brooklyn, NY asked on February 3, 2023 in Foreclosure and Real Estate Law for New York","After your default for 120 days, your lender or the lender&#039;s servicer may elect to send you a default notice or a letter of acceleration. Accelerating the loan means that they are calling it as fully due and payable now instead of over the regular loan term. They may also send you a 90-day pre-foreclosure notice under RPAPL 1304 which is the New York law requiring that. After they send out the necessary notifications, they might file a summons and complaint with the Supreme Court for the county where the real estate is located and a lis pendens, or notice of pendency, with the county clerk which is public notice that there is a foreclosure action pending on the property. Foreclosure can take quite a long time in New York but you should take immediate steps to address this. You should hire an experience attorney to assist you with a loan modification, foreclosure defense, or if you simply wish to get rid of the property, you may be able to surrender or sell it. There are options to consider but these options can be lost and time barred if you delay.

What happens after you default mortgage 120 days,"Brooklyn, NY asked on February 3, 2023 in Foreclosure and Real Estate Law for New York","New York is a judicial foreclosure state, which means that a creditor-sale of a piece of residential real property cannot happen without a court order. The lender first needs to provide you with certain pre-foreclosure notices, and then ultimately file a summons and complaint and serve you with it.  
 
The case then moves to mandatory mediation, and ultimately if a loan modification is not worked out, the lender will need to file a motion to obtain a court order to sell the property. Homeowners in New York generally have a significant amount of time to address any mortgage default, but you need to take the appropriate steps to preserve all of your rights .

I really don&#039;t know, whom should we speak for the clearance. we also have a contract that says nothing about custom closets or building windows.","Your (the seller&#039;s) attorney is really the best person to contact about this, since he or she is, for purposes of the down payment, the escrowee.  If you already closed the sale, it is not clear why your sale proceeds check was not issued at the closing; the closing constitutes the transfer of title and the closing of escrow so checks are typically distributed then.  Did the closing occur? did the buyer&#039;s attorney or title agent receive a deed? did other checks get distributed?  Was there perhaps an escrow agreement signed at the closing for something that may have come up?  Closings sometime happen fast with a lot of paperwork being passed around, so these are important questions on which the attorneys and the title closer likely have all of the facts.",1
"I have accidentally signed two leases, I did not know I was signing the leases when I did it.","I haven&#039;t moved into the place, the leases are for 2023-2024.","It would be helpful to have more information about the leases and the facts surrounding them.  For example, how was it that you did you not know you were signing a lease if you in fact signed it?  The facts surrounding the signing and whether a contract was formed may also be relevant.  Was there some form of fraud or coercion?  Was whatever you signed countersigned?  It is a pretty factually-heavy scenario so having an attorney review would likely be productive.",1
How long does it take a lender to find substitute Administrator ?,"The property is in Brooklyn . My father was the only person on the mortgage. When I was added to his deed , I was recorded as the Administrator. I only found out recently that I needed court papers to become an Administrator, which is what I am trying to do now.

How long in kings county does it take a lender to find a substitute Administrator?

How long in kings county does it take a lender to find a substitute Administrator? Thank you",Only Surrogate Court can appoint an administrator for an estate.  The lender or bank will foreclose on the property if the lein is not paid.  The creditor can apply to court for an administrator such as PA to be appointed if no one comes forward.  It depends on the case and how quickly the petitioner submits all the required documents which will dictate how long it takes.   The creditor can proceed to foreclose by following certain procedures.  You should seek advice from my Probate Estate attorney as soon as possible,0
Can the bank sell my property if no Administrator  has been appointed?,"Before my father died , I was incorrectly added to the deed , “As Administrator” .  I have been working on obtaining Letters .

I am now waiting for the Court to issue me Letters so that I can represent the Estate . The property is being foreclosed on .  Can the bank force a sale of my father’s property even when there is not a Court appointed Administrator?","It would be helpful to know where the property is, but generally a foreclosing lender will have the ability to substitute a party in the case of the death of a mortgagor/defendant.  Other relevant factors that would be helpful to know are whether the decedent owned the property solely or with a joint tenants and what stage of the foreclosure process the case is in.  Foreclosures in New York have several phases and there is some nuance to how a case moves from one to the next.  Regardless, you&#039;d want to notify the plaintiff&#039;s attorney and the Court that there has been a death of a party if this has not already been properly done.  Like many legal matters that affect significant legal and financial rights, I would highly recommend you have both estate counsel as well as foreclosure counsel since there are a lot of moving parts.",3

A foreclosure action forecloses the rights of the property’s owner, as well as subordinate lienholders—so all are served to provide notice of the action and any legal consequences it may have.   
 
While the senior foreclosing lender should take title free and clear of subordinated liens, those lienholders may have a right to surplus if there was one (as well as whatever other remedies you would maintain against the note obligor and other property he/she had).",0

The selling agent of the house we were going into contract with had prior knowledge of a lien and did not disclose,PROPERTY LOCATED  in AVERILL PARK NY what are my options as the buyer if the sellers agent was aware of an imminent lien was to be placed on the property but let me go into contract anyway only to have the closing being stopped the very day of the closing because a $75K lien was placed on the property 2 days after I signed the contract.

As a Landlord can I submit a bounced rent check intended for a previous month to cover money currently owed by tenant?,"As a landlord, my tenant owes me money for a months rent and refuses to pay.

My question is with regards to liability.

There are different types of joint ownership the two most common in this instance are &quot;joint tenants with rights of survivorship&quot; and tenants in common.

"hi, someone i know recently moved into an apartment with lots of mold that they didn’t know was there",they are now experiencing health problems from said mold and yet their landlord won’t release them from the lease. what can be done about this?,"Assuming that this is in NY, there is an implied warranty of habitability under the New York Real Property Law § 235-b. If your landlord doesn&#039;t repair the qualified conditions, then you have the right to withhold the rent. If the filthy condition has been established as well as its serious interference with your friend&#039;s living, and his/her landlord knows about it, you may have a good case.  
 
However, before you start withholding the rent, you may want to take certain steps, setting your emotional distress aside. You will probably too want to set aside the rent monies in a separate bank account as a proof that you are not indigent and can pay the rent. 
 
First, and most importantly, you need to ensure the landlord knows of the bad condition. Some times, landlords, especially those who hire and delegate their tasks to management companies, don&#039;t know of your bad condition. You may want to send a letter to the landlord (certified mail or the method required under your lease) explaining the bad condition, your request for proper repairs and your intent to withhold certain rent amount if no improvement is observed in XXX days. You want to do this even if your landlord and you are close, friendly or greet ever morning, or your landlord makes promises verbally. 
 
What you may want to keep in mind is that when you withhold your rent payment for any &quot;legitimate&quot; reason, your landlord will probably sue you for non-payment of rent, leading to a litigation in the Housing Court at which time retaining a lawyer will probably be recommended.",0

Can closing/real estate lawyer steal broker commission?,"New York, NY asked on November 12, 2020 in Real Estate Law for New York","&quot;Steal&quot; is a very strong word with various subjective meanings associated with it. You need to provide more specific factual background of your case.  
 
If your RE attorney (usually representing the seller) is supposed to hold the commission for you, then of course, s/he will not be allowed to refuse to tender or expend the money. If, however, you are a self-proclaimed real estate broker for the seller/buyer who claims that services were rendered in connection with the transaction and s/he is thus entitled to some commission, then not getting the commission at closing may not constitute &quot;stealing&quot; by the counsel since you may not be entitled to anything.",0
If I’m moving can I remove a floor that I paid for and put down,"Saint Cloud, FL asked on November 7, 2020 in Real Estate Law for New York","You could add Landlord-Tenant as a category here, as this is an issue L-T attorneys are confronted with. A landlord-tenant attorney would probably ask you what physical actions would be involved in removing your floor - and whether the process would be destructive and leave a surface that looks the worse for wear.

If I put down a floor then I move can I remove it,"Saint Cloud, FL asked on November 7, 2020 in Real Estate Law for New York","More specifics will need to be disclosed to better answer the question. Assuming that your situation concerns New York, usually, it depends what the lease says. Sometimes you have the obligation to return the premises in the same condition as existed when leased. Sometimes, the lease says you can leave the premises as it is with certain conditions to be met. If you made some structural changes to the premises consented by the landlord, and the lease is silent on what has to be done upon your departure, then discuss with the landlord and you may want to execute an addendum to the existing lease.",0

"We overbid on a house, are there any strategies to bring down the price we offered? It was our agents listing. See below",We found a property of interest in East Northport Long Island. Price on property was listed for $425K with property tax of $4781/yearly. This was also a listing of our agent. She informed us there are multiple offers since the property was priced below market value. We had offered 525K &amp; they accepted our offer. Now I think about it we jumped the gun. We love the property because it’s such a steal for .25 acres and under 5K for property tax. After doing some research we realized agents may use phantom offers to trick us bidding the highest price.

What made you become a lawyer? What do you wish you knew at my age (15)? How do I become a lawyer? Any pros and Cons?,I am doing an interview for a summer program and would like true answers if possible.,"If you want to be a lawyer because you think you will make lots of money, forget it. While a small minority of lawyers makes a very good income going to big firms, working long hours (80 hour weeks) or corporate law, most lawyers make modest incomes equivelent to much less demanding jobs. You are still very young. You need to do well in high school so you can go to a good college. Then you need to do well in college, get a good GPA and do well on the LSATs.   As a lawyer you need to be able to put yourself in your client&#039;s shoes, with the added experience and knowledge of the law. Sometimes you will be representing people who you find dispicable, but that is your job. You can not put your own agenda ahead of your client&#039;s.  Going to law school is very hard. I went at night while working full time during the day. I coulod not afford the tuition. It is very expensive.  If you get into a top notch school (Harvard, Yale, NYU, etc) and do well (top 10 in your class), you will be able to get those high paying jobs, if that is what you want. If you go to a lower level school and do well you might still be able to get the higher paying jobs, but it is more difficult. If you can not get into a high level school, or do extremely well, then, honestly, it doesn&#039;t matter as much where you go. The mid level law jobs do not usually look at your grades or care what school you go to.  One route many take is to get a job in the prosecutor&#039;s office and get courtroom experience. It looks good on your resume and it gets you good experience. But the pay is relatively low. Good luck.",1

What is the normal cost of a real estate attorney in Albany NY for a home purchase?,This is for an out of state buyer who is doing a first time purchase of a home in NY.  What should a buyer be asking when trying to determine the most cost effect way to hire a real estate attorney?,"The real estate attorneys here could give you the most meaningful input, but you&#039;re waiting for a reply and as a general matter, a good way to find out could be to contact attorneys and ask their fees. As with attorneys in any field, you could ask their area of focus, their experience, and other questions you could probably find posted on realtor&#039;s online resources. Sometimes the best thing to do might be to spend two minutes speaking with the attorney and rely on your instincts whether you would like to work with them for the brief transaction period. Also pull out a map and find out where the closing will take place - it won&#039;t generally make sense for an attorney to drive three hours to handle a closing. Good luck

They can dictate terms as to what forum will be used to resolve disputes or what jurisdiction&#039;s courts will be used. If you are going to invest in a consult with an attorney, check if the contract has a forum selection clause stipulating which state&#039;s laws will apply - it would make sense to consult with an attorney in that state, as the laws of that state would govern. Good luck

Can you use your security deposit to cover rent in NYS (due to COVID) if you are at the end of your lease?,My partner and I suffered substantial income loss due to COVID and we advised our landlord that we would like to use our security deposit for our June rent. Our lease is up on 7/31 and we will likely move out as we can no longer afford our rent because of income reductions. We have an excellent payment history and have been here for 5 years. Our July rent was paid by deposit when we moved in. Our landlord is telling us that we cannot use our security deposit to cover our June rent if we are moving out. Is this correct?,"You can use your security to pay the rent.  Technically, you are supposed to replenish it, but it is not necessary.",1

Florida foreclosure and property lien??,Trying to make this simple... I live in NY a neighbor of mine needed a loan of 25k...

"Selling sister&#039;s condo, profit of $65K, she is a missionary in Peru how can she avoid taxes until return in few years?","Hi. My sister has been a missionary in Peru for four years, and plans to do this for several more years.  I am in the process of helping her sell her Condo in NYC.  She will have a net equity profit of approximately $65,000 at sale, she does want to use this to buy her next home when she returns from her mission.  She is 56 years old and will probably settle down in Florida when she finishes her missionary work.  Is there a way she can postpone the tax hit on the $65,000, without directly purchasing another home within the year of selling of her condo in NYC?  Thank you!","If the property has been her primary residence and she has not changed residency then the property would qualify for the personal residence exemption and the first $250k in gain would be exempt.  
 
There needs to be an analysis of her residency status. Just because she&#039;s out of the country doesn&#039;t mean she has changed residency. It&#039;s hard to make that determination with limited facts and those facts should not be discussed on a forum.  
 
Also, it appears that you&#039;re referring to a 1031 exchange in the later part of your question. A 1031 has much stricter time limits than the same year and is no longer available for non-business property under the TCJA. If you wanted to consider a 1031 you&#039;d have to convert to a rental first and exchange for a new rental property. There would need to be a conversion back to personal use at some point which may create a taxable event and is risky in the event of an audit.  
 
I would hire a professional. There&#039;s enough here to justify the cost.  
 
Best of luck.",0

Thank you!","It is possible that she qualifies for exclusion of capital gain on that sale. It sounds like she could avoid all of the estimated $65K in gain under Tax Code Section 121(c), as long as she sells before she is out of the home for about 4.5 years. The opportunity is much more challenged after that. However, there is possibly another opportunity for her to take a full exclusion of all gain, applying IRC Subsections 121(c) and 121(d)(12), because her work is much like that of the Peace Corps, which also has a special exception. 
 
I would consider planning a sales based upon the assumption that the tax can be excluded, if the timing of the sale meets the exceptions mentioned above.

(note: my parents live in different states, but the house is in NY)","You are messing up legal terms and concepts, and making this way too complicated.  By contempt of court, I assume there is a matrimonial case.  If there is a decree there, your mother must do what the decree says.  If it was a stupid decree, you may need a motion in that case to clarify or amend it.  A &quot;quitclaim&quot; deed is often required in divorces when one spouse gets the property.  It is a deed without warranty, and not the best way to convey title but bad matrimonial lawyers often use that term.  Whether there are mortgages of record can be determined by a simple title search, and depending on the county, online.  No deal between your father and mother can change whatever your mother signed with a bank.  If there is a loan, there is a loan, and the decree in the divorce should have dealt with it.

"I purchased a home where $5,000 was kept in escrow for the owner to submit paper work to take care of the back deck",Which did not have a permit. I recently found out from my town that there are a couple other things in my house such as the front bay window that does not have permits for. I’m confused how the sellers lawyer and my lawyer did not know or how could sell a home without it not having all permits up to date. What can I do because I don’t feel I should be responsible for the cost now to get all permits up to date?,"Caveat Emptor! You should read your contract and see what is says and whether there are any representations and warranties as to any work performed. Attorneys generally are not going to review all renovations made to the house to confirm they were done legally. This is closer to a due diligence request for a contractor/architect/engineer.

We bought a mobile home with land in Oswego N.Y on October 6th 2020,The seller paid the taxes on the property on October 4th before we purchased.

We feel he is responsible for paying the taxes before we purchased but need our deed. What can we do?,"What does the contract say?

Often, it is the case that the seller prepaid for part of the quarter and will receive a credit at closing for the time the seller is not in possession.",1
With the current National Emergency  is it conceivable some residential  contracts could be void in some cases?,"For example, say someone signed a contract 45-60 days ago, is it conceivable at some point in the near future (quarantines, lockdowns, clusters of outbreaks) a contract could be void because of the virus?  Somewhat akin to &quot;damage&quot; perhaps?  Or circumstances out of the seller/buyers control?","It&#039;s probably unlikely that contracts would be considered void, as that would declare there is something defective in a contract, such as illegality or failure to meet requirements for formation of a valid contract. Textbook contract law holds certain conditions that serve to discharge performance, such as impossibility, frustration of purpose, etc., but in real life, those could be difficult concepts to assert. Time will tell, but hopefully, it won&#039;t come to that. Speak to a practitioner who handles real estate closings as a daily matter; they would have their finger on the pulse of this in terms of the emerging national and statewide response. Good luck

what forms do i need to complete to transfer real property to a living trust?,"Clifton Park, NY asked on February 28, 2020 in Estate Planning, Real Estate Law and Tax Law for New York","Real estate is transferred using a document of conveyance called a deed.  However, there are a variety of types of deeds, and the choice is not always obvious.  I do not ever recommend using quitclaim deeds because of issues with insurability.   That leaves possibly a warranty deed or a special warranty deed.  Which to choose depends on other factors, such as whether you have title insurance on the property already and, if so, which policy form was used.

"I have a real estate worth $850.000 in Long island city, NY. How much tax my kids and spouse has to pay when i pass away","Asked on February 26, 2020 in Estate Planning, Real Estate Law and Tax Law for New York","If the house was in your name alone, then it will get a step up in basis to fair market value (FMV) upon your date of death.  If your heirs were to sell it thereafter for the date-of-death FMV, then the gain would be zero, so nothing to tax.  If they hold it for a while and it continues to gain in value, there might be a tax (depending on other factors, such as who lived there and for how long), but at most it would only be on the gain that accrued since your date of death. 
 
If your spouse is on title with you, then only your half interest would get a step up in basis to date-of-death value (unless you hold title as community property, which is unlikely in NY).  In that case, there might or might not be a capital gains tax, but other factors would need to be considered, such as how long your spouse owned the house and resided in in prior to the date of sale.  If she lived in it and owned her interest for at least two of the five years preceding the date of sale, then she can exclude $250,000 of gain under Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code.",0

How do the new rent regulation laws affect a corporate lease to a nonprofit organization?,If I want to lease the whole vacant building to a nonprofit how can we ensure that the potential tenants won&#039;t become stabilized?,"If the building is operating under a municipal contract to provide housing to the homeless, then the tenants are exempt from rent stabilization. If there is no municipal contract, however, it is subject to rent stabilization unless otherwise exempt. One of those exemptions is where a charitable organization or non-profit is using the premises for its affiliates. This does not mean its clients. So, for example, if a University is using the premises to house its professors and students, those are affiliates. If, for example, the Salvation Army is using it to house unwed mothers, those are NOT affiliates. They are clients. However, still another exemption is for an “asylum” and the unwed mothers would fall under that category such as to exempt them from rent stabilization. But mere charitable status is not an exemption. However, under that same scenario, if the Salvation Army rented an apartment to an ordinary person as a mere tenant, that ordinary person would be residing in the unit as a rent stabilized tenant. If, however, that apartment were occupied by a social worker employed by the Salvation Army and having received the apartment for purposes of ministering to the unwed mothers, that apartment would be exempt as an “affiliation” unit, as noted above. As this brief synopsis shows, the issues can get very tangled and wind up relying on nuances of the facts presented.",0

Is it necessary to correct the document before closing? 
Will it cause issues when selling the property in the future?",Greetings.  This appears to be a scrivener&#039;s error.  You will need an attorney to reform the document.  The attorney will file an action in court asking the court to determine whether 10 or 20 feet was intended by the parties that created the easement.  The Town will be joined as a party to the lawsuit.  Your attorney will present proof one way or the other depending on the evidence available in conjunction with your best interests.  Your real estate attorney will likely be able to file the action for a reasonable charge.  Good luck.,0

What happens to husband and wife holding title together after divorce?,"Hi.  
I’m reading a title now where the husband and wife took title in 1966 as John Doe and Jane Doe, his wife. Said husband has passed and contract of sale shows “Jane Doe as to 50% and the executrix of the will as to the decedents 50% as sellers”.  
Since title was never changed I think the wife would own title wholly because title was held as husband and wife. I should show Jane Doe as surviving tenant by entirety and raise an exception calling for proof of a Notice of Severance that would’ve severed the joint tenancy. Am I correct? Or will the divorce alone sever ?",The divorce severs the entirety interest and creates a tenancy in common.  Accordingly the contract is right.,1

The NYC DOB says my curb cut and home parking is illegal after 45 years.","I&#039;ve lived in my home for 45yrs.

Do my brother and I have any rights to Dad&#039;s house since he had no will?,"Our parents owned our family house in Lynbrook, NY since 1962. My mother died in 1974. Dad married Clare soon after and in 1996 added C to the deed. He passed away in 2004. C removed his name from the deed. I have copies of the deed and subsequent alterations. Neither our father nor mother had a will of any kind. C no longer lives in the house. My brother and I wonder if we have any claim on the house when it is sold since Dad BROUGHT THE HOUSE INTO THE MARRIAGE when he married Clare.

Your children will receive the rest evenly.” Could my brother and I inherit half of the proceeds, minus $50,000?

"Is it legal or illegal for a realtor to list apt for rent,while people are still living there(their lease is not up)","I live in a building managed by a company (although the owners of the building are the same people who own the management company)

Some said maybe it was a mistake when they saw their apartment listed for rent 
But it wasn’t  
We realized the entire second floor was listed  
And only one apartment was empty and for rent

Landlord says I&#039;m not allowed on roof of apartment advertised as having &quot;private roof deck&quot;,"I recently signed a lease for an apartment that was advertised as having &quot;private roof deck&quot;. The posting went as far as including staged photos of said roof-deck furnished with patio furniture.  
 
The roof has only one entrance through a door inside the apartment.  
 
The landlord now claims we have no right to be on the roof.  
 
The lease makes no specific mention of the existence or absence of a roof. 
 
What can I do? I rented the place under the pretense that I am getting a roof, and I believe I was reasonable in coming to that impression based on the posting and communication with the realtor even in the absence of explicit mention in the lease.

MY FATHER RECENTLY DECEASED.  HOW DO THE REMANING SIBLINGS HAVE THE RIGHT OF THE HOUSE.,THE DEED IS IN BOTH MY MOMS AND DADS.  THE KIDS ARE NOT ON THE DEED. HOW DO WE PROCEED WITH THE CHANGE OF DEED WITH THE CHILDREN NAME ON IT IN CASE OF MOTHER PASSES AWAY.  HOW DO WE INSURED THAT THE PROPERTY IS RIGHTFULLY OURS,"If the property was acquired by your parents during their marriage, it was probably owned as a “tenancy by the entirety”. That means when your father died, your mother was automatically 100% owner. There are several options to make sure it goes to the kids upon her death. She can sign a new Deed, set up a Trust, or make a Will.",0
MY FATHER RECENTLY DECEASED.  HOW DO THE REMANING SIBLINGS HAVE THE RIGHT OF THE HOUSE.,THE DEED IS IN BOTH MY MOMS AND DADS.  THE KIDS ARE NOT ON THE DEED. HOW DO WE PROCEED WITH THE CHANGE OF DEED WITH THE CHILDREN NAME ON IT IN CASE OF MOTHER PASSES AWAY.  HOW DO WE INSURED THAT THE PROPERTY IS RIGHTFULLY OURS,"The primary questions are: Does your mother have the legal capacity to make decisions; and assuming she does, what are her wishes as far as the house goes. She is in control. 
 
If your mother wants the house to go to her children, the first thing to do would be to check the name on the most recent Deed to the house. If the names are just your mother and father as Tenants By The Entirety or Joint Tenants With Rights of Survivorship, then when your father died your mother became the sole owner of the house. If the Deed was titled in some other way the situation might not be as clear. 
 
Putting your names on the Deed, presumably for no payment, would amount to a gift by your mother which would raise some immediate tax issues which would have to be considered. It also prevents certain changes from being made without the consent of the other parties named on the Deed. 
 
Your mother could put the house into an irrevocable trust. That would also raise some immediate tax issues that would have to be considered. Many people resist this because they think they are losing independence and it prevents them from making changes should their wishes change in the future. 
 
Adding names to the Deed or putting the house into an irrevocable trust may not be possible if there is a mortgage on the house. 
 
Your mother can make a Will giving the house to you and your siblings, but a Will can be revoked. 
 
The Will is certainly the simplest way to go, but the intention can be defeated even if the Will were not revoked. For example, your mother might put a mortgage on the house, reducing the value of what the beneficiaries might receive because the mortgage would have to be paid off. Your mother could also sell the house during her lifetime and then there would be no house for you and your siblings to receive.",0

What can be done about a pile of junk that was left on a purchased property?,"I discovered it when looking at property I purchased in the fall.

It took me the rest of the fall and into winter to move and had no reason to go out to that area until the other day and the junk is still there.","Unfortunately there is little you can do once you closed on the purchase.

"My lease is ending soon (rent-stabilized + preferential rent rider in lease). With HSTPA, can my landlord raise my rent?","My lease is ending on June 30, 2022. It was for 1 year and 3 months, with the 3 months being &quot;free&quot; due to rental concessions. I am worried that when our landlord gives us the 90 day required notice of renewal on April 1, it will try to increase our rent exorbitantly after looking at current listings for similar units in our building. I have been doing some research and found that under HSTPA of 2019, preferential rent cannot be raised to the legal rent upon lease renewal. There is a preferential rent rider in our lease, but my understanding is that the 2019 changes to the rent laws under HSTPA made all preferential rents permanent, regardless of whether there was a rider in the lease stating otherwise. Additionally, there is a &quot;Tax Benefits&quot; rider in our lease stating that our building is subject the Rent Stabilization Law under 421-a of the Real Property Tax Law.

I am looking for case law on disputes between homeowners and building departments in NY,"My attic has sheet rock but is unheated.  my town building department is calling it a &quot;violation&quot; because it has no &quot;egress window&quot; we are at the zero hour of closing the sale of the house and are being held up by this violation.  I have been told unheated space cannot be called living space.  Also, I asked for a report on anything outstanding on my property in JUNE so we would avoid this situation. also the attic was in its current condition before I bought the house. Now my sale is in jeapordy and I&#039;m not selling because I want to - I really have to sell my house to survive financially.  I want to know if I have a case to argue and resolve this so I can close this sale.   I hope you can help!","Unheated space cannot be living space.  The issue is the fault of your lawyer when you bought the house, your broker who listed it now as a &quot;living space&quot;, and your lawyer who allowed this issue to fester until closing.  While it is sometimes reasonable to overlook these issues at a closing knowingly, if you bought it thinking it was a legal space, you were misadvised.  There are only two resolutions.  Tell the buyer to take &quot;as is&quot; or no deal, or hire an architect to bring heat up to the space and legalize it.  The cost of bringing heat to the attic will depend on your system, but is likely not that expensive.  The issue is your Certificate of Occupancy varies from your listing.  This one is on you, not the buyer.",0
Do I have a case against previous homeowner for NOT disclosing an invasive species of plant taking over our yard?,"We did a walk through on the house in late October, placed a bid that was accepted and, closed in December and then in the spring these plants started growing all over the yard, we discovered what they are (Japanese knot wood) and found out that they are very invasive and can eventually cause problems with the foundation. This information was NOT disclosed to us before we closed and I am just curious as to see if this is something that is supposed to be disclosed or if I’m just out of luck?","Probably no (out of lock) unless you had a specific provision for it in the sales contract designed to survive the closing.  
 
Seller usually has the obligation in NYS to present Property Condition Disclosure Statement to the purchaser, but often times the obligation is waived by giving an additional $500 to the purchaser as part of the closing adjustment. Even assuming you received the Statement signed by the Seller, the plant issue will not constitute a &quot;material&quot; defect subject to the disclosure requirements, and it&#039;s highly possible that the Seller didn&#039;t even know of the type of the plant or even it exists.",1
In the process of buying a home and sellers attorney isn&#039;t responding to calls/emails. What next?,"The sellers lawyer has been minimally responsive to our lawyer in this transaction. The other lawyer waited 6-7 weeks before ordering the title update, and we just found out there are 2 liens that weren&#039;t properly discharged. My attorney is emailing every other day and giving explicit details on what to do next. The other lawyer has yet to acknowledge the title isn&#039;t clear and/or if he has taken any action to properly discharge the mortgages. 
 
Is there anything else we can do in this situation? We are selling our current home too and are worried our buyers are going to drop out (we&#039;ve been in this process now for a little over 2 months).","You have a lawyer, so that person is closest to the situation.  It may be the seller cannot convey clean title, in which case, assuming you used the form contract, they can get out of the deal.  If that is the ultimate result get out now.  You can sue to enforce the deal, but honestly, it is not worth it.",0
We are leaving a NY apt and they are withholding our 6800 security deposit because they said we didn&#039;t notify in time,"My daughter and her husband live in New York City on the Upper East Side and they recently vacated an apartment. 
 
It had a very large security deposit of 6,800.  Their lease stipulated that they needed to inform the landlord at least 60 days of their leaving, by registered letter.  They did so, and received verbal confirmation from the landlord that the letter had been received.   Now the landlord is saying that he never received the letter and is withholding the deposit. 
 
The problem is, that my daughter&#039;s husband lost the receipt for the registered letter.So it&#039;s their word against the landlord.  Can they fight this in small claims court in NY?   Can they win this in a &quot;my word against yours&quot; situation?","A landlord-tenant attorney could have the best insight here, and the question probably remains open for two weeks because it was overlooked in these categories. You could repost under Landlord-Tenant. There&#039;s no guarantee all questions are ultimately picked up, but it could have better chances of being seen there. Good luck

Is a lease valid if tenant never rendered any funds?,"Lease was signed, and person moved in but no security deposit or rent has been paid at all","This is something that the landlord-tenant attorneys here would have the most insight into, but your post remains open for a week. It was probably overlooked in the Real Estate Law category. There&#039;s no guarantee that all questions are ultimately picked up, but you could try reposting and adding Landlord-Tenant as a category. Good luck

You have confused several legal concepts. New York State allows for an oral lease of residential property for up to one year. Your offer of a one-year lease may very well be deemed an oral lease, as you were the proponent, and the tenant signed the lease. Does the lease contain the terms that this lease is not effective until signed by both tenant and landlord? If so, letting the tenant move in without you also signing the lease seems like you now have an oral lease for one year. If so, you are bound by the terms and conditions of the lease, and there is no rent increase available.  \n \nThere is no legal notion of Major Capital Improvement (rent increase) beyond Rent Stabilization (and Rent Control). In a non-regulated rental, the landlord does not need any reason to offer a new lease (Real Property Law Section 226-C) with a rent increase of more than 5% above the current rent. But you cannot do so during the current lease.  \n \nDo you want a long-term relationship with this tenant (decide with an attorney if this makes sense--as the tenant has some understanding of the law)? If you do, why did you offer a lease and allow the tenant to move in without signing the lease? With a lawyer, you may develop a written proposal for a long-term lease with a new rent structure to give the tenant."}, "5": {"input": "As a landlord how much notice do I have to provide tenants to leave property if I\u2019m in the process of selling?New York, NY asked on September 6, 2023 in Landlord - Tenant for New York", "output": "Generally, landlord&#039;s are not required to provide any advance notice to tenants that a property is being sold.

In addition, judgments against any of the owners could become liens on the property and any one owner could file for partitition and potentially force a sale of the entire house. \n \nIf you have already considered those issues, the difference between tenants-in-common and joint tenants pertains to the right of survivorship.  For example, business partners typically own property as tenants-in-common and if one of the partner&#039;s pass away the deceased owner&#039;s share in the property is inherited by his or her heirs or beneficiaries.

You will probably too want to set aside the rent monies in a separate bank account as a proof that you are not indigent and can pay the rent. \n \nFirst, and most importantly, you need to ensure the landlord knows of the bad condition. Some times, landlords, especially those who hire and delegate their tasks to management companies, don&#039;t know of your bad condition. You may want to send a letter to the landlord (certified mail or the method required under your lease) explaining the bad condition, your request for proper repairs and your intent to withhold certain rent amount if no improvement is observed in XXX days. You want to do this even if your landlord and you are close, friendly or greet ever morning, or your landlord makes promises verbally. \n \nWhat you may want to keep in mind is that when you withhold your rent payment for any &quot;legitimate&quot; reason, your landlord will probably sue you for non-payment of rent, leading to a litigation in the Housing Court at which time retaining a lawyer will probably be recommended."}, "763": {"input": "I have a weird question.
